# Program4

Basic image classification.

## Stages and pipeline

Program consists from:

- Image reading stage
- Image preprocessing
- Image classification
- Results iterpretation

### Image reading stage

``` python
Image().read()
```

### Pipeline

Now we need to create pipeline to combine stages:

``` python
```

---

## Call pipeline

For calling pipeline we need input:

``` python
```

To call pipeline use:

``` python
Evaluator(pipeline).run(read_input)
```
